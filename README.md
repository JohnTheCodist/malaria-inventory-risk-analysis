### 🔍 Project Overview
Antimalarial stock-outs during peak malaria season can delay treatment, increase patient risk, and force pharmacies into costly emergency procurement.
This project analyzes historical pharmacy malaria data to determine whether malaria demand is seasonal and how inventory strategies can be optimized to reduce stock-out risk while avoiding year-round overstocking.

The analysis was inspired by a real-world debate on whether malaria cases are truly seasonal, and uses real pharmacy dispensing data to explore the answer empirically.

### 🧠 Business Problem

Pharmacy managers often lack clear visibility into:

When malaria demand actually peaks

Which months carry the highest stock-out risk

How much buffer stock is truly necessary

As a result, inventory decisions are frequently reactive rather than data-driven.

### 📁 Data & Scope
Pharmacy malaria case data (2019–2022)

Monthly aggregation to detect seasonality

Segmentation by patient group (Adults, Teenagers, Children)

Risk scoring based on demand level and volatility

⚠️ Note: This analysis uses data from a single pharmacy and is not intended for population-level conclusions. The goal is to demonstrate analytical thinking and decision-oriented insights.

### 📈 Dashboard Snapshot

Key insights from the dashboard:

Malaria demand and stock-out risk are highly seasonal, peaking sharply during the rainy season.

Only three months (June–August) require aggressive inventory intervention, with July as the single highest-risk month.

### 🧭 Business Implications

Inventory risk is concentrated, not continuous.
Maintaining elevated stock levels throughout the year is inefficient and ties up working capital. A targeted, seasonal stocking strategy can significantly reduce stock-outs without increasing total inventory cost.

### ✅ Recommended Actions
Increase buffer stock by 30–40% ahead of June–August

Prioritize Adult ACT formulations during pre-rainy-season procurement

Reduce stock levels during low-risk months to improve cash flow

Monitor July demand more frequently during peak season
